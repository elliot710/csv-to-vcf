# MyHeritage to VCF Converter

This script converts a raw DNA data file from MyHeritage (in CSV format) to a VCF file.

## Usage

1.  Place your MyHeritage raw DNA data file (e.g., `raw_dna_data.csv`) in the same directory as the script.
2.  Make sure the `input_file` variable in the script is set to the name of your MyHeritage file.
3.  Run the script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python convert_to_vcf.py
    ```

4.  The script will generate a VCF file named `dna_data.vcf`.
